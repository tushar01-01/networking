## History Of Internet
* Before 1960: Communication medium were telegraph and telephone network. Suitable for constant rate communication using circuit switched network.   
  
* 1960: Search for such network started which could connect PC from different manufacturers running different technologies from ARPA(Advanced Reseaerch Project Agency).
The main purpose was cost effective file sharing.

* 1961: Packet Switching for such networks introduced by Leonard Kleinrock at MIT. 

* 1967: ARPA presented an idea for ARPANET. That multiple devices could be connected using mobile connection for sharing data using packet switching technique by the devices called IMP(Interface Message precessor) which are now called the routers.
  
* 1969: ARPANET became reality.Software NCP(Network Control protocol) provided communication. four host universities were connected which are univerisity of Utah, UCSB, Stanford and UCLA.   
  Making these four higher institutions the first hosts of what would one day be called INTERNET.

* 1972: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn proposed internetting project. To link different types type of network. To overcome the cons they gave idea of device called geteway aka router. 

* 1973: Cerf and Kahn propose protocols for end-to-end delivery of data a new NCP. Paper included encapsulation, datagram and functions of gateway. 

* 1983: TCP/IP introduced in ARPANET. 

* 1983: MILNET(Military Network) was created deriving from ARPANET.

* 1985: Similarly CSNET(Computer Science Network) got created for universities with computer science department.   

* 1986: NSFNET replaced ARPANET.

* 1991: ANSNET repalaced NSFNET due to its increasing internet traffic. 

The internet today is a set of pair network that provide services to the whole world. Intenet today is famous because of its applications.  

*`In 1990 when Tim Berners Lee developed the world wide web(www) the internet came to its true existence which is similar to today's internet.`*

*`Later on mutimedia applications came to internet.`*
